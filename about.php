				The Cycle Happy Leeds Cycling Club was established in 2009 by a group of cycling friends living in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. <br>
				<br>

				The aim of the club is to enjoy and promote road cycling in one of the most beautiful areas of the country and to do this in a friendly and enjoyable environment. <br>
				<br>

				We are primarily road cyclists (drop-bar) and a typical run out will involve a route from Leeds, which will normally be around 50 miles on our Sunday Club Run, 
				and most of the time does involve stopping off at a cafe to recharge our batteries with coffee and cakes.  <br>
				<br>
				
				If numbers are sufficient we aim to have three groups on the road as follows: <br>
				<br>

				Steady paced ride: Approx 15mph average <br>

				Medium paced ride: Approx 17-18mph average <br>
				
				Faster paced ride: Approx 19-20mph average <br>

				We normally ride three times a week on a Sunday morning, Tuesday and Thursday evenings, meeting outside Cycle Happy Leeds Office, Regent Street, Leeds, LS2 7QN, but please check the calendar to confirm events and rides. <br>
				<br>

				Ladies Section: <br>
				<br>

				We also have a growing Ladies section who ride once a week on a Saturday morning, also meeting at Cycle Happy Leeds Office. <br>
				<br>

				We also meet on the first Friday of every month in the Hoagys Bar - John Barras in Leeds from 7.30pm for a few beers and to discuss anything cycling or club related. <br>
				<br>

				The Cycle Happy Leeds Cycling Club is also affiliated to British Cycling. <br>
